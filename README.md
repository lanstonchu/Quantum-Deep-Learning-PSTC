# Quantum-Deep-Learning-PSTC

This paper aims to solve machine learning optimization problem by using quantum circuit. Two approaches, namely the average approach and the Partial Swap Test Cut-off method (PSTC) was proposed to search for the global minimum/maximum of two different objective functions

# Global Optimum Search in Quantum Deep Learning

This paper aims to solve machine learning optimization problem by using quantum circuit. Two approaches, namely the average approach and the **Partial Swap Test Cut-off method (PSTC)** was proposed to search for the global minimum/maximum of two different objective functions.
